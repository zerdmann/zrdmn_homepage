<section id="body_copy">
<p>The Kingdom of a Ends is a fictional film based on John Brown, the abolitionist. While Brown is most well known for his raid on the United States Armory in Harper's Ferry Virginia, the film focuses on his time spent in Kansas 5 years before his act of treason. In the midst of an political scuffle in Kansas, John turned from outspoken idealist to guerilla warrior and cemented his path towards violent rebellion.</p>

<p>In 1854, The Kansas-Nebraska Act established that all new American territories would decide laws on slavery individually, based on popular vote. This meant both the North and South had a new chance to spread their ideologies and protect their standing in the Union. People immigrated to Kansas from all over the country in hopes of swaying the laws of the new land. Included in this migration were John Brown and his adult sons.</p>

<p>John was a polarizing figure in the battle for Kansas' future. Those on the pro-slavery side hated his rough and direct opposition to their belifs. On the anti-slavery side he didn't fare much better. His extreme convictions and inability to be pragmatic clashed with a group more concerned with their own future in their new home than in an outright ideological battle.</p>

<p>These conflicts eventually led Brown to abandon political beauracracey for terrorism. In the central action of the film John leads a small group of men on an overnight massacre, pulling 5 men know to be sympathetic of slavery from their homes and murdering them. This night echoes throughout the rest of the film and through the lives of the characters. For John there is no turning back, he has headed down a path that can only end with political martyrdom. For his sons they are forced to deal with the consequences of their father's actions, ending in capture, torture, and death.</p>

<p>Throughout all of this, John's relationship with his wife Mary acts as a counterpoint to his increasing ferocity. When John travels to Kansas, Mary stays behind in upstate New York, tending to their farm and children. Through letters to each other we are given another a view of a life that John has chosen to give up: A life of small actions, of pracitcal change, and progress built on a notion of community.</p>

<p>In the end John is hung for treason. For John this is the best possible ending, a final act to bring great attention to his cause. For Mary and his children, and indeed for all Americans, it is endlessly complicated. John Brown is a man who was not afraid to put his ideals into action, something America often prides itself for. These actions were a major catalyst for pushing our country to Civil War, eventually ending in the abolishment of slavery. But just as John's actions left his family broken, the war left scars in our culture that have never healed.</p>
