<h3>Olsen + Peterson Wedding</h3>

<p>John and Marla, who got married in Glacier National Park, Montana, asked me to build a wedding webiste for them after seeing the work I put into <a href="/work/wedding/">my own</a>. Coordinating a destination wedding on a budget is a ton of work, so I planned out a choose&#45;your&#45;own adventure website that would help them collect information about each attending guest. I tied that togehter with the idea of a slideshow of backgrounds that would cycle through some of the stunning vistas in Glacier National Park.</p>

	<span>I kept the design transparent to keep the focus on the background images.</span>

<p>By far the hardest part of implementing <a href="http://johnandmarla.zrd.mn">the site</a> was scaling the slideshow images for different page resolutions. In the end I hand&#45;scaled the batch of images to dozen different resolution breakpoints and then used a javascript function to grab window resolution on page load and then request the smallest scaled image appropriate for the display size. The page is heavier than I would like on load, but once it has all the assets in memory it moves pretty smoothly.</p>


<p>Making a single page psuedo&#45;app was a good opportunity to flex my <abbr>AJAX</abbr> muscles as well. I stored the question data as a <abbr>JSON</abbr> object and just repopulated the form on click. I kept all the form data in the <abbr>DOM</abbr> until submission, which meant there was no continuity of session between visits, but for the goal of the website it wasn't a problem.</p>
