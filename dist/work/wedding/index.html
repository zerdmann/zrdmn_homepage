<p>Sick of the generic wedding websites I saw most of my friends make using prefab tools, I decided to try my hand at building <a href="http://pnzymg.zrd.mn">something custom</a>. I had played around with web design before, but this was my first attempt at building an entire website on my own.</p>

<p>I really wanted a nice single page structure with no scrolling, but needed to squeeze a good amount of information on the page, so I decided on an accordion structure, with fluid columns that resize on click.</p>

<p>Rather than use existing accordion structures I spend the time learning the fundamentals of jQuery and built my own. It ended up both much lighter on page load and significantly more gratifying.</p>

<p>I also worked up a thank you note design for us to send out after the wedding. This would have been a great opportunity to learn letterpress printing, which is something I&apos;ve always wanted to do, but time and money had other plans.</p>
