		At Penzeys Spices I worked on a stand-alone web feature profiling same-sex couples in Wisconsin to build support for the ACLU challenging the same-sex ban in the state. This was my last project at Penzeys and the first design project I handled all the way through on my own.

		When my writing partner asked if I could build him a website for his Glacier Mountain destination wedding, I knew it was an opportunity to push my skills even further. We layed out a twenty question choose-your-own adventure questionaire in PHP and AJAX.

		The first website I ever build on my own was for my Summer 2014 wedding. Mostly this was just me playing around in jQuery with a little PHP form to handle RSVP. I also did some print design for the invitations and thank you cards.
