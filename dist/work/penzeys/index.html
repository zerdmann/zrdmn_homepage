<p>As a writer/designer at Penzeys Spices I worked on a feature during Wisconsin’s pending gay marriage legislation called “Love is Love.” The initial assignment was to set up a stand-alone web feature with some central unifying copy and a series of individual profile pages for the featured couples and their family recipes.</p>

<p>I started by spitballing a few typographic treatments of the title phrase. This was the first creative project at Penzeys I worked on solo and I wanted to get ideas on paper to receive feedback and direction. The first few iterations were definitely off the mark, but they got conversation started with the other designers that helped me hone in on something closer to what the Creative Director was looking for.</p>

<p>One of the suggestions was that I incorporate subtle rainbow iconography into the design, and move closer to the handwritten look that Penzeys had already established. I was hesitant about the rainbow motif being a little cliched in a piece about gay rights, but I set up the best take on it I thought possible.</p>

<p>This round of feedback was much more consistent: The copy flow and layout were strong, but I was still lacking the feel of Penzeys' branding. I was given a selection of sign painter typefaces to start working with, and then, amazingly, told to bring the rainbow out a little more. So I went back to the drawing board, this time with a box of crayons.</p>

<p>At this point, although all attempts at subtlety were gone, I got approval from the Creative Director to go ahead and work up an HTML version of the design for publication. About a week later the state supreme court overturned Wisconsin’s ban on gay marriage and we decided not to run the piece. I left Penzeys to move to Chicago shortly after. A version of this content, arranged by another Penzeys designer, is available on the Penzeys website with no rainbows in sight.</p>
